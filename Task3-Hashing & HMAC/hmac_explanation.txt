When we changed one letter in the file, the HMAC value completely changed.
This happens because even a tiny modification in the message leads to a totally different hash output — a property called the avalanche effect.

HMAC is important because it doesn’t just check integrity, it also verifies authenticity.
Unlike a regular hash, which anyone can recalculate, HMAC requires a secret key.
That means only someone who knows the shared key can generate the correct HMAC.
If the message or key is changed, the verification fails immediately.

In simple terms, HMAC helps make sure the data hasn’t been changed and that it really came from someone you trust.
